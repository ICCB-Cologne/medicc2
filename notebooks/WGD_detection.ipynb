    "# Calling WGDs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run MEDICC2 in the standard (and recommended way) from the command line, the WGD status will be outputed both in the `_summary.tsv` file as well as in the `_copynumber_events_df.tsv` file (these are calcualted using approach 1, see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we shows how to call WGDs inside python using MEDICC2.\n",
    "There are two approaches to do this. The standard way (Approach 1) runs MEDICC2's main routine which reconstruct a phylogentic tree of the samples. It then reconstruct the ancestral states (i.e. internal nodes) and infers events for every branch of the tree. If MEDICC2 detects a WGD in a branch, all nodes that lie downstream of that branch are considered to have a WGD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second approach we calculate the optimal copy-number events directly from the diploid state for every sample individually. In the case that the phylogenetic tree and the ancestral states are correct, this leads to exactly the same events and therefore the same WGD calls as in approach 1.\n",
    "In some cases however, MEDICC2 is not able to accurately infer the tree structure and/or the ancestral states. This is mainly the case for single-cell experiments with 100s-1000s of samples and a high noise-to-signal ratio. It is possible that MEDICC2 misses a WGD in the corresponding branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the WGD detection differs between the two approaches, there is likely a mistake with the phylogeny creation, i.e. the reconstructed tree is not accurate. In this, we would recommened to rather trust the WGD calls that were created per sample and not from the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, approach 2 can be run with a bootstrap approach, where the WGD detection is repeated multiple times with varying inputs. This is the most accurate approach for WGD detection but of course also the most time-intensive. Usually we use a threshold of 5%. See the MEDICC2 publication for details."
